Ugly Number 

Write a program to check whether a given number is an ugly number.

Ugly numbers are positive numbers whose prime factors only include 2, 3, 5. For example, 6, 8 are ugly while 14 is not ugly since it includes another prime factor 7.

Note that 1 is typically treated as an ugly number.

class Solution {
public:
    bool isUgly(int num) {
        if(num < 1)
            return false;
        
        while(num != 1)
        {
            if(num % 2 == 0)
            {
                num /= 2;
                continue;
            }
            
            if(num % 3 == 0)
            {
                num /= 3;
                continue;
            }
            
            if(num % 5 == 0)
            {
                num /= 5;
                continue;
            }
            
            return false;
        }
            
        return true;
        
    }
};


//solution : for all the ugly num, we can keep divide 2,3,5 to get num == 1, for those non-ugly num
//we can break the loop by (missing all 3 conditions)

//PS: dividing the num to test whether or not it meets some requirements are very common:D
