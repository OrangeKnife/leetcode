Number of 1 Bits



Write a function that takes an unsigned integer and returns the number of ’1' bits it has (also known as the Hamming weight).

For example, the 32-bit integer ’11' has binary representation 00000000000000000000000000001011, so the function should return 3.


class Solution {
public:
    int hammingWeight(uint32_t n) {
        int ret = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < 32; ++i)
        {
            ret += int((n>>i) & 1);
        }
        return ret;
    }
};

//solution: shifting n to get all the bits, use & 1 to grab only the last bit after shifting, add it to ret
