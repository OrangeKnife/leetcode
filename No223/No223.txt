Rectangle Area 

Find the total area covered by two rectilinear rectangles in a 2D plane.

Each rectangle is defined by its bottom left corner and top right corner as shown in the figure.

Rectangle Area
Assume that the total area is never beyond the maximum possible value of int.


class Solution {
public:
    int computeArea(int A, int B, int C, int D, int E, int F, int G, int H) {
        
        
        int total = ( (C-A)*(D-B)) + ((G-E)*(H-F));
        
        
        if(E > C || F > D || G<A || H<B)
            return total;
            
        int sharedArea =  (min(C,G) - max(E,A)) *(min(D,H) - max(F,B));
        
        
        
        return total - sharedArea;
    }
};


//so how to calculate the sharedArea?, draw the retangle 1 first, there are only 4 ways to draw the retange 2 , upleft, upright
//downleft,downright, then try to write down the corner of the shared are, don't use if else statement to calculate
//use min and max to get the corners!
