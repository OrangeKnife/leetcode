Factorial Trailing Zeroes 

Given an integer n, return the number of trailing zeroes in n!.

Note: Your solution should be in logarithmic time complexity.

class Solution {
public:
    int trailingZeroes(int n) {
        int ret = 0;
       
        while( n != 0)
        {
            n = n / 5;
            ret += n;
        }        
        
        
        return ret;
    }
};

//solution: this is a problem about "how to count how many 5s in n!"
//so it means how many 5s 25s 125s ... and add them together 
//which equals n/5  + n/5/5 + n/5/5/5 + ... 
//using a loop to iterate n down to 0
//done.
//I didn't invent this :(
