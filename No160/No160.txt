Intersection of Two Linked Lists 

Write a program to find the node at which the intersection of two singly linked lists begins.


For example, the following two linked lists:

A:          a1 - a2
                   \
                     c1 - c2 - c3
                   /            
B:     b1 - b2 - b3
begin to intersect at node c1.


Notes:

If the two linked lists have no intersection at all, return null.
The linked lists must retain their original structure after the function returns.
You may assume there are no cycles anywhere in the entire linked structure.
Your code should preferably run in O(n) time and use only O(1) memory.

//this page explains a lot of solutions: http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/write-a-function-to-get-the-intersection-point-of-two-linked-lists/

//Solution: First of all, count the lengths of both two lists. Compare the length, move the start point of the shorter list and start to iterate both lists, whenever you find two nods are the same, is the one you have to return;
//return NULL, if none node found.
